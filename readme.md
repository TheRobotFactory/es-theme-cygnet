## EmulationStation Theme: Cygnet  
Cygnet is a clean theme based on my earlier Cygnus theme that displays large preview images, videos, etc and some useful user-oriented metadata. Cygnet comes in three colour schemes, 'Cygnet' 'mono' and 'terminal'.  Designed specifically for the RG351M using the batocera emulationstation.
  
**NOTE: Cygnet uses theme version 7 features. You will need the latest batocera emulationstation for the video, marquee, and carousel features to work correctly.**  
   
### Cygnet theme config file  
Using the features of batocera emulationstation all the settings for Cygnet are in the UI Settings -> Theme Options menu of Emulationstation. You can pick a primary theme color and a region from EU/JP/US which will change some of the artwork to the required region. Use the folders NES for Famicom, Megadrive for Genesis, PCEngine for TurboGrafX. Set your region accordingly.
