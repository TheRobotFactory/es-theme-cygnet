<!--
Cygnet theme config file
========================

There are two files included below, one is a colorset, the other is a template.
Valid changes you can make here are as follows.

Colorsets
---------
Cygnet.xml             <--- This is the default blue colorscheme
mono.xml               <--- This is a black and grey colorscheme
terminal.xml           <--- This is a green colorscheme

Templates
---------
Cygnet.xml             <--- All bells & whistles. Lots of metadata, lots of art
nometa.xml             <--- No metadata, all text except gamelist removed
simpleart.xml          <--- Large art, no overlayed boxart or marquee images
simpleart-nometa.xml   <--- Minimal theme with just a gamelist and large art
